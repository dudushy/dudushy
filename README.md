## 📑 **Experience:**

- Intern at **SPEDO TECNOLOGIA** - On-site *(05/2022 - 01/2023)* ✔️
    
    > At the beginning of my career, I worked with web development using PHP (CodeIgniter and Composer) and the MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure to build dynamic and responsive websites. During this period, I used Bootstrap to create user-friendly interfaces and MySQL for data management, generating charts and statistics (BI) from database records. Simultaneously, I developed mobile applications (Android and iOS) for the automotive sector, automating internal processes in dealerships. Using Ionic (with Cordova and Angular), I worked on file handling (photos and texts), API and Web Services consumption (HTTP), and designing layouts focused on user experience. Additionally, I participated in the implementation of the applications, visiting dealerships to directly assist users in adapting to the new tools.
    > 
- Systems Analyst at **SPEDO TECNOLOGIA** - Remote *(02/2023 - 01/2024)* ✔️
    
    > As a Development Analyst, I deepened my knowledge in mobile application development for Android, utilizing the Ionic framework, NodeJS, Git, and GitHub for version control, documentation, and workflow automation (Actions/Workflows). My responsibilities included cloud data synchronization, file manipulation and formatting, Web Services and API consumption, creation of intuitive layouts and color palettes. I was also responsible for implementing plugins, components, and responsive pages, ensuring the best user experience. I used Android Studio emulators and Ionic's Live Reload feature to accelerate the development and debugging process.
    > 
- Programmer at **UPRISET SOLUÇÕES** - Hybrid *(02/2024 - 10/2024)* ✔️
    
    > In my most recent position, I was responsible for leading the development and maintenance of websites and mobile applications, managing databases, servers, and API integrations. I used GitHub Actions to automate tests, builds, deployments, and releases, as well as Bash scripts to optimize the development environment (with FTPs, SDKs, and other dependencies). I created and maintained optimized work environments, facilitating the workflow of the entire team. Additionally, I was involved in managing and training interns, sharing knowledge and ensuring the success of team projects.
